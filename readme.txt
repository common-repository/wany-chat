Wany.Chat turns your WooCommerce store into Selling Chatbot. Ready for Facebook Messenger and Instagram DM.
Can be used inside ManyChat platform

== Description ==

Wany.Chat is a plugin that creates a fully functional selling Chatbot from your WooCommerce store.
Supports WooCommerce shipping methods and payments via Robokassa and Mercado Pago
Connect it using [ManyChat](https://manychat.com/) platform or directly via Facebook

### Chatbot works in Facebook Messenger and Instagram DM

* Lists your products and product categories
* Displays products info: photos, prices, attributes (sizes, colors, etc) with respect to current stock
* Enables cart and order checkout process directly in Messenger and Instagram
* Notifies human agents on questions and help requests from customers
* Sends promotional messages to engage and re-engage visitors

### Why do you need it?

* Facebook Messenger and Instagram DM are the new channels to get customers from and re-engage with them
* You've already set up a WooCommerce store. Why not making a chatbot from it, right?
* Be closer to you customers. Chat with them directly while leaving routine interaction to the bot
* Remind about yourself for *FREE*. Facebook Messenger and Instagram DM let you send promo messages inside 24-hour window after each interaction initiated by customer
* Remind about yourself using Facebook Paid Messages. Address *your* audience. This proves to be much more cost-effective comparing to Ads
